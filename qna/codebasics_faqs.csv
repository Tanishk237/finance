How can I use PowerBI on my Mac system?,"Hi

You can use VirtualBox to create a virtual machine and install Windows on it. This will allow you to run Power BI and Excel on your Mac.

If you're not familiar with setting up a virtual machine, there are many resources available on YouTube that can guide you through the process. Simply search for ""installing virtual machines"" and you'll find plenty of helpful videos.

"In sales analytics chapter , when creating pivot table a blank column is getting added. How to solve this?","Hi, please check these instructions.

Option - 1:
If you are from India, you can change your system default date format to India, then restart your computer once. and see, whether it fixed your issue or not. Else you can follow the second option.

Option - 2:

1. Reason for the Issue:
In the dim_date table, the date is in dd/mm/yyyy format. Whereas the fact table is in mm/dd/yyyy format. Because of the different formats, causing the issue. Power BI/Excel will likely use your system's default date format whenever you open any file. This could cause the date format issue - dd/mm/yyyy --- mm/dd/yyyy. Please look for this whenever you face issues with values mismatch.

2. Steps to resolve:
    1. Change the data type of the date column to �Date� if it is in �Date/Time� format. Skip this step if it is already in �Date� format.
    2. Create a new custom column in the fact_sales_monthly table. you can name it date_modified or any other name accordingly.
    Formula
    = Date.ToText([date],""yyyy"") & ""/"" & Text.PadStart(Text.From(Date.Day([date])),2,""0"") & ""/"" & Text.PadStart(Text.From(Date.Month([date])),2,""0"")
    3. change the data type of the above-created column to date.
    4. In Power Pivot, Go to the 'Manage' tab and select the 'Diagram' view. Map the date column in the 'dim_date' table with the newly created column in the 'fact_sales_monthly' table. Make sure to delete the previous relationship (date from fact_sales_month)."
"why row and value option is not showing for the visual in PowerBI , any setting need to be change, please let me know?",You have selected Table Visual instead of Matrix. That is why you are seeing a different interface.
"Hello, I have a issue to calculate WHF%. Can you give me numbers for checklist and debbuging?","Hello 

Please confirm whether you got these values right!

Before Data Cleaning Stats:
Number of rows: 6336
Number of distinct employees: 198
Number of distinct employee_id: 106

After Data Cleaning Stats:
Number of rows: 6208
Number of distinct employees: 99
